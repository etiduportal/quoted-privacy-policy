# Quoted – Privacy Policy

_Last updated: 29 November 2025_

## 1. Overview

Quoted is a Chrome extension that helps you copy rich, formatted quotes (with source, author and date) from any web page.  

This extension is designed with privacy in mind. It does **not** collect, store or transmit any personal data to our servers or to third parties.

## 2. Data we access

Quoted temporarily accesses the following information **only on the pages where you use it**:

- The text you select on the page
- The URL of the current page (used as the “Source” of the quote)
- Optional author and publication date, when they are available in the page’s structured data or meta tags

This information is used **only to build the formatted quote** that is copied to your clipboard.

## 3. How we use this data

- The selected text, page URL, author and date are processed **locally in your browser**.
- The result is copied to your system clipboard so that you can paste the quote in another application (e.g. a note-taking app, email, document, etc.).
- We do **not** send this information to any server.
- We do **not** store this information anywhere.

## 4. Permissions explained

Quoted uses the following Chrome permissions:

- **"activeTab"**: allows the extension to access the content of the currently active tab *only when you invoke the extension*.
- **"scripting"**: allows the extension to inject a content script on the current tab, in order to read the selected text and page metadata.
- **"contextMenus"**: allows the extension to add a right-click menu item (“Get Quote”) when text is selected.
- **"clipboardWrite"**: allows the extension to write the formatted quote into your clipboard.

These permissions are used **exclusively** to provide the core quote-copying functionality.

## 5. Data sharing

- We do **not** sell, rent or share any data with third parties.
- The only external website involved is [Buy Me a Coffee](https://buymeacoffee.com), which is opened **only if you click** the “Buy me a Coffee” link in the notification toast.
- Visiting that external website is under your control, and their own privacy policy applies there.

## 6. Children’s privacy

Quoted is a general-purpose productivity tool and is not directed at children. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.

## 7. Changes to this policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page, with an updated “Last updated” date.
